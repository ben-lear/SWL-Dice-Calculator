# GAME MECHANICS


Star Wars: Legion is played over a series of five Rounds. Each Round is divided into Turns, taken by each player. The following sections contain the rules that specify the parts of each Round and how to play them.

in a player's army and not be defeated if they are referenced with "or", and all of the characters must be included in a player's army and not be defeated if they are referenced with "and". When that unit's name is included in the effects section of that COMMAND Card without specifying allied or enemy, it refers to only allied units with that name.

PARTS OF A ROUND

Each of the five Rounds in a game of Star Wars: Legion
are divided into the following phases:

1. The COMMAND Phase

2. The Activation Phase

3. The End Phase

RESOLVING
COMMAND CARD
EFFECTS

1. COMMAND CARD EFFECTS that occur when the

COMMAND Card is revealed, starting with the Blue Player

2. COMMAND CARD EFFECTS that do not have a specific

timing, starting with the Blue Player

THE COMMAND PHASE

3. COMMAND CARD EFFECTS that occur when a unit issues

Orders, starting with the player with priority.

During the COMMAND Phase, players select a COMMAND Card from their COMMAND Hand, reveal and resolve their COMMAND Cards, DETERMINE priority, issue Orders, and create the Order Pool.

PARTS OF THE
COMMAND PHASE

1.

Select and Play COMMAND Cards

2. Resolve COMMAND Cards

3. DETERMINE Priority

4. Nominate Commanders and Issue Orders

5. Create the Order Pool

6. Create the Pass Pool

S ELECT AND PLAY COMMAND
CARDS

Each player secretly chooses a COMMAND Card to play from their COMMAND Hand and places it facedown on the battlefield. If a player does not have at least 1 undefeated p or o unit, and does not have any units with Commander TOKENS, they may not play any COMMAND Cards this Round.

Some units have several unique COMMAND Cards, which may only be played if that unit is included in a player's army and is not defeated. Those COMMAND Cards belong to that unit. To play a COMMAND Card's that has a restriction mentioning multiple units, at least 1 of the named units must be included

4. COMMAND CARD EFFECTS that occur at the start

of the Activation Phase, starting with the player with priority.

5. COMMAND CARD EFFECTS that occur during the Activation Phase, starting with the player with priority.

R ESOLVECO MMAND CARD
EFFECTS

After both players have played a COMMAND Card facedown, they then reveal their COMMAND Cards by flipping them faceup and proceed to resolve the effects of the COMMAND Cards. Fully resolve the effect of each COMMAND Card before moving to the next COMMAND Card. If both players have an effect that occurs at the same time, the blue player resolves their COMMAND Card effect first.

DETERMINE PRIORITY

Once players have resolved all relevant COMMAND CARD EFFECTS, compare the number of pips on the COMMAND Cards that were played this Round. The player whose card has the least number of pips has priority for the Round.

If both players reveal COMMAND Cards with the same number of pips, one player rolls a red defense die. If the result is a d, that player has priority. On any other result, the other player has priority.

If one player was unable to play a COMMAND Card due to not having a p or o unit, the other player automatically has priority. If neither player played a COMMAND Card, one player rolls a red defense die to DETERMINE priority. 21

EXA MPLEPL: AYIN G A COMMAND
CARD AND DETERM I NINGPRIO RITY

Michael and Kevin are choosing their COMMAND Cards for the turn. They each secretly choose a card from their hands to play, then they reveal their cards at the same time. Michael has played a 3-pip card, Assault, and Kevin has played a 1-pip card, Ambush. Because Kevin played the card with the fewest number of pips, he gains priority for the Round.

Sarah and Michael are choosing COMMAND Cards for the turn. Both of them play the 4-pip card Standing Orders. Because they revealed cards with the same number of pips, 1 of them rolls a red defense die. Michael rolls the die and rolls a blank. Because he did not roll a d, Sarah has priority for the Round.

NOMINATE COMMANDERS
AND ISSUE ORDERS

After determining priority, players nominate Commanders and issue Orders to their units.

If the played COMMAND Card corresponds to one or more specific units, one of those units must be nominated as the Commander. Otherwise, players may nominate any 1 p unit to be their Commander.

current COMMAND Phase.

- The unit must match the type (if any) listed on the

COMMAND Card.

When a unit is issued an Order, take an Order token that corresponds to the unit's Rank and place it faceup next to the unit. A Commander must issue all the Orders allowed by the COMMAND Card, if able. If a Commander cannot issue all the orders allowed by the COMMAND Card, any excess Orders are lost. Once both players have issued Orders, they then proceed to create the Order Pool.

OTHER WAYS TO
ISSUE ORDERS

Some rules or abilities allow units to be issued Orders from sources other than the nominated Commander. These units do not have to follow the above criteria when they are issued Orders in this way, instead following the rules of the effect granting that Order. A unit cannot be issued more than 1 Order each Round.

CREATETH EORDER POOL

After issuing Orders, each player creates their Order Pool by taking 1 Order token that matches the Rank of each undefeated unit that was not issued an Order and shuffling those Order TOKENS together.

CREATETH E PASSPOO L

After creating the Order pool, each player counts the number of undefeated units they control. The player with fewer undefeated units adds a number of Advantage TOKENS to their Pass Pool equal to 1 fewer than the difference in those counts. Once players have created their Pass Pools, if any, the COMMAND Phase is over, and the Activation Phase begins.

EXAMPLE: CREAT ETHEPAS S
POOL

Nick has 8 undefeated units and Ben has 12. The difference between the counts is 4. 1 fewer than that is 3, so Nick adds 3 Advantage TOKENS to his Pass Pool.

THE ACTIVATION
PHASE

Once all players have nominated a Commander, they issue Orders to their units, starting with the player who has priority. The number of Orders and the units they can be issued to is listed on each COMMAND Card. For a Commander to issue an
Order to a unit, the following must be true:

During the Activation Phase, players activate their units and may make actions with them.

Starting with the player who has priority, players take Turns activating their units one at a time.

- The unit cannot have already received an Order during the 22

CHOOSE A UNIT TO ACTIVATE
ORPA SS

The active player chooses to either activate an allied unit with a faceup Order token or to draw an Order token randomly from the Order Pool and activate a unit matching that Order token's Rank that does not have an Order token. Alternatively, a player may be able to Pass. When a player Passes, they do not activate a unit and their Turn ends.

If a player draws an Order token with a Rank that does not have any corresponding undefeated allied units that do not have an Order token, remove that token from the game. Then that player may Pass. If they do not Pass and still have units to activate, they must choose to either activate an allied unit with a faceup Order token or to draw another Order token randomly from the Order Pool.

If a player did not Pass on their previous Turn this Round, they may spend 1 Advantage token in their Pass Pool. If they do, they Pass.

If a player does not have any units they can activate, they Pass.

UNIT COHESION

When a unit leader miniature changes position in any way, all other miniatures in the unit must be put into Cohesion. For a miniature to be in Cohesion, all of the
following must be true:

Each miniature must be within 7 of its unit leader. When measuring Cohesion, the Range Tool may not overlap impassable terrain. -

Each miniature must have LOS to its unit leader.

Each miniature must be within a vertical distance equal to the height of the unit leader's Silhouette of its unit leader.

If a miniature cannot be put into Cohesion, place it as close as possible to its unit leader instead.

RALL Y STEP

Each time a unit activates, it has a chance to Rally and remove Suppression TOKENS. To Rally a unit, its controlling player rolls 1 white defense die for each Suppression token the unit has. Then its controlling player removes 1 Suppression token for each d or e result rolled.

After a units Rally step, if a unit begins its Make Actions step while Suppressed, it makes 1 fewer action during its Make Actions step.

When a unit is chosen to activate, it first attempts to Rally, and then the unit may make actions. After the unit has completed its actions, flip the unit's faceup Order token facedown or assign it the drawn Order token facedown.

If a unit begins its Make Actions step while Panicked, it cannot make any actions or free actions. Then, if a unit did not make any actions or free actions due to Panic, at the end of the unit's Activation, it removes Suppression TOKENS equal to its . 23

EXA MPLESUPP: RESSED AND
PANICKED

On Ryan's turn, he chooses to activate a Rebel Trooper unit with 2 Suppression TOKENS. After RESOLVING any effects at the start of the Rebel Trooper unit's Activation, he performs the unit's Rally step and rolls 2 white defense dice, 1 for each Suppression token. Unfortunately, he rolls 2 Blanks and does not remove any Suppression TOKENS from the unit. Because the Rebel Troopers have a  of 1 and have a number of Suppression TOKENS equal to or greater than their , they are still Suppressed and must make 1 fewer action during the Make Actions step of their Activation.

Additionally, because the Rebel Troopers have Suppression equal to or greater than double their , they are still Panicked as well as Suppressed. Therefore, they make no actions or free actions, and at the end of their Activation, they remove Suppression TOKENS equal to their .

COMMANDERS AND
CHECKING FOR
PANIC

When a unit checks to see if it is Panicked, instead of using its own  it may use the  of an alliedp unit within 3. For EXAMPLE, a unit with 3 Suppression TOKENS and  1 would not be Panicked if it chooses to use the  of an alliedp within 3 that has a  of 2 or greater.

NULL  Some units have a null , or "-." These units can never gain or be assigned Suppression TOKENS and cannot be Suppressed or Panicked. If a unit gains a null  through a special rule, it loses any Suppression TOKENS it has, if any. If a p unit has a null , then allied units within 3 may choose to use that p unit's  and, therefore, never Panic, regardless of the number of Suppression TOKENS they might have.

- Attack: The unit makes an attack with its weapons.
- Card Action i: The unit makes an action listed on its Unit Card one of its Upgrade Cards, a COMMAND Card, or a Battle Card. A unit may make more than one Card action, as long as they are different. A Card action with ii requires 2 actions to make.

- Dodge: A unit that makes a Dodge action gains 1 Dodge token. Units may spend Dodge TOKENS to cancel a results during attacks.

- Free Card Action h: The unit makes an action listed on its Unit Card, one of its Upgrade Cards, a COMMAND Card, or a Battle Card. Free Card actions do not cost the unit any actions to make. Free Card actions have this symbol h. A unit may make more than one Free Card action, as long as they are different. A unit may only make free actions during its Make Actions step and may only make each instance of a free action once per Activation. Free actions do not allow a unit to make a non-Move action more than once during its Activation.

- Move: When a unit makes a Move action, it makes a

Standard Move or Climb.

- Recover: A unit that makes a Recover action removes any

number of Suppression TOKENS from the unit and readies any number of the unit's exhausted Upgrade Cards. -

Standby: The unit gains 1 Standby token, which it can use to make actions in response to enemy actions. Only Trooper units and Ground Vehicles can make the Standby action.

DEP LOYING UNITS

When an undeployed unit makes a Move, it Deploys. When a unit Deploys in this way, measure the start of the Move with both prongs of one end of the Movement Tool touching the portion of the edge of the battlefield within allied Territory. When a unit Deploys, the unit leader measures the vertical distance changed during that Move starting from the portion of the edge of the battlefield the Movement Tool is touching. When an undeployed unit activates, it must Deploy and may not make any action that is not a Move until it Deploys. Only undeployed units can Deploy.

MAKE ACTIONS

MOVEMENT

During the Make Actions step, a unit may make up to 2 of the actions below. A unit may only make each action once per Activation, except for the Move action.

- Aim: A unit that makes an Aim action gains 1 Aim token

which it can use to reroll dice during attacks.

When a unit makes a Move action, it makes a Standard Move or Climb. Miniatures have one of two types of bases-notched or unnotched. What kind of base a miniature has determines how that unit makes Moves. Creature Troopers, Emplacement Troopers, and Vehicles all have notched bases. For more information on unit types, see pg. 39. 24

LEAV ING THE
BATTLEFIELD

Units may not voluntarily end a movement with any of its miniature's bases partially or fully outside the battlefield. A miniature may leave the battlefield temporarily if it ends its movement with its base fully inside the battlefield, such as when a unit with a notched base moves along the Movement Tool. If this is not possible, the miniature stops its movement when it contacts the edge of the battlefield, then it loses any remaining actions and may not make any free actions.

STANDARD MOVE

To make a Standard Move, take a Movement Tool of lower or equal Speed of the moving unit and place it flat on the battlefield so that one end wholly touches the base of the unit's unit leader. Then, the player may adjust the joint of the Movement Tool as they wish. After the Movement Tool has been adjusted, pick up the unit leader miniature and place it on the battlefield in contact with any portion of the Movement Tool. A unit may choose to use a Movement Tool of a lower Speed when making a Move unless otherwise specified.

After placing the unit leader miniature, pick up any other miniatures in the unit and place them in Cohesion. If for any reason a miniature cannot be placed in Cohesion at the end of a Move, place it as close as possible to the unit leader.

When moving the unit leader of a unit with multiple miniatures, that unit's controlling player may temporarily put non-unit leader miniatures in that unit out of the way to make room for the unit leader, placing these miniatures in Cohesion as normal after the unit leader is placed.

EXAMPLEMA: KINGSTAND ARD
MOVES

Marco is activating an undeployed unit of B1 Battle Droids. He declares a Move action to Deploy them by making a Standard Move. As the Battle Droids are Speed-2, he may choose either the Speed-1 or Speed-2 movement Tool. Marco chooses the Speed-2 Movement Tool and places it flat on the battlefield so that both prongs of one end of the Movement Tool touch the edge of the battlefield within allied Territory. Then, he may adjust the Movement Tool at its joint as he wishes. After he is content with the placement and position of the Movement Tool, Marco picks up the Battle Droid's unit leader and places it back down on the battlefield in contact with any portion of the Movement Tool. Then he picks up the rest of the miniatures in the Battle Droid unit and places them so that they are all within 7 of their unit leader.

With their first action complete, Marco declares the second action of the B1 Battle Droids will be another Move action. Because the Battle Droids are now Deployed, he places the Movement Tool on the battlefield so that one end wholly touches the unit leader's base. He then adjusts the Movement Tool and places his unit leader in contact with it. Finally, he picks up the rest of the miniatures in the Battle Droid unit and places them so that they are all within 7 of their unit leader. 25

EXAMPLE: MOVIN GWIT HNOTCHED
B ASES

Simone chooses to make a Standard Move with her Swoop Bike Riders. Since the Swoop Bike Riders have the Speeder X keyword, she cannot rotate the unit leader's base. She then chooses to use the Speed-3 Movement Tool since the Swoop Bike Riders are Speed-3. She places the movement Tool in the front notch of the Swoop Bike Riders unit leader's base. Next, she adjusts the Movement Tool as she wishes, then decides if she wants to make a full or partial Move. She decides to make a full Move and picks up the miniature and moves it along the Movement Tool, making sure to keep the Tool lined up with the front and rear notches on the miniature's base. She then places the miniature so that the rear notch is on the opposite end of the Movement Tool.

NOTCHED BASE MOVEMEN T

Units on notched bases follow all the above rules for movement. Additionally, a unit on a notched base must execute the
following steps to make a Standard Move:

1. The player may rotate the unit leader's base up to 90° to the left or right, keeping the center of the base in the same place.
2. The player takes a Movement Tool less than or equal to the unit's Speed characteristic and places it flat on the battlefield so that one end is wholly inside the front notch of the unit leader's base.

3. The player may adjust the Movement Tool at its joint as

they wish.

4. The player decides to make either a full Move and proceeds step 6 or a partial Move and proceeds to step 5. Unlike normal bases, notched bases cannot be placed anywhere along the Movement Tool and instead Move along the Tool with different REQUIREMENTS based on this decision.

5. To execute a partial Move, pick up the unit leader miniature and move it along the Movement Tool, taking care to keep the Movement Tool lined up with the front and rear notches on the base. The player may choose to stop this movement anywhere along the path created by the Movement Tool, moving the Movement Tool out of the way and placing the miniature on the battlefield. The miniature must be placed in such a way so that the line of the front and back notches on its base are parallel to the section of the Movement Tool the miniature reached at the farthest part of its Move.
6. To execute a full Move, pick up the unit leader miniature

and move it along the Movement Tool, taking care to keep the Movement Tool lined up with the front and rear notches on the base. The player places the miniature so that the other end of the Movement Tool is inserted in the back notch of the miniature's base.

7. When a miniature makes a full or partial Move, if the base of the miniature is impeded by an object while moving, it must stop its movement prematurely unless it can legally Move through, over, or on top of the obstructing object. Move the Movement Tool out of the way and place the miniature on the battlefield accordingly.

8. After placing the unit leader miniature, pick up any

other miniatures in the unit and place them in Cohesion. Miniatures with notched bases must be placed in the exact same directional orientation as their unit leader's base. If for any reason a miniature cannot be placed in Cohesion at the end of a Move, place it as close to the unit leader as possible.

NON -STANDARD
MOVES

Climb and Pivot are not Standard Moves. These Moves each have a separate rules entry describing how they are made. 26

MOVING THROUGH
MINIATURES

Miniatures can move through and overlap other miniatures during a Move, but they cannot end a Move overlapping other miniatures.

If Simone wishes to make a partial Move instead, she simply stops the miniature's movement along the Movement Tool at the desired point and places it on the battlefield in such a way so that the front and rear notches on its base are parallel to the section of the Movement Tool the miniature reached at the farthest part of its Move.

ABILITIES THAT
PROVIDE MOVES

Some abilities provide Standard Moves, often of certain Speeds. A Move provided by an ability is not a Move action unless specifically stated.

If terrain impedes a full or partial movement, the miniature must stop prematurely. Because the tower is stopping the Swoop Bike Riders movement, it ends its movement even though it has not traveled the full distance of the Movement Tool.

MINIA TURES
PHYSI CALLY
INTE R FERIN G WITH
MOVEMENT

While moving a miniature, treat the non-base portion of all miniatures as if they do not exist. A miniature's movement cannot be impeded by the non-base parts of itself or another miniature.

MOVINGTH ROUGH TERRAIN

Battlefields in Star Wars: Legion are often covered with terrain that impedes troops' movements.

When a unit makes a Standard Move, if it begins or ends a Move with any of its miniatures in difficult terrain, or the Movement Tool overlaps a piece of difficult terrain, the unit reduces its Speed by 1 to a minimum of 1 during that Move. This may force the unit to use a Movement Tool of a lower Speed than it originally intended.

Miniatures can make Standard moves onto or through obstacle terrain that is shorter than the height of the moving unit's Silhouette. When placing the Movement Tool, it may not overlap an obstacle terrain feature that is taller than the moving miniature's Silhouette. When a unit is overlapping an obstacle terrain feature, it may make a Standard Move if the vertical distance changed is not greater than the height of the moving unit's Silhouette. If they wish to Move onto, off of, or through obstacle terrain greater than the height of their Silhouette, they must instead make a Climb. Miniatures on notched bases may not Climb.

Impassable terrain completely prevents movement. Miniatures cannot Move or Climb onto or through impassable terrain unless they have a special rule which allows them to do so. 27

EXA MPLEMA: KING AST ANDAR D
MOVETH ROUGH TERRAI N

Move. Instead, Sarah makes a Climb with the Clone Troopers. The Clone Troopers Move as normal, except they must use the Speed-1 Movement Tool when Climbing, and they may Move up to a vertical distance of height 1 when making a Climb.

MELEE

Melee is close ranged, hand-to-hand combat between two or more units. When two miniatures controlled by opposing players are in BASE CONTACT, those units are in Melee.

MOVING INTO MELEE

Evan declares a Move action with his Clone Trooper unit and chooses to make a Standard Move with them. As the clones are Speed-2, he may choose either the Speed-1 or Speed-2 Movement Tool. However, because the Clone Troopers are starting their Move on difficult terrain, their Speed is reduced by 1 to a minimum of 1, meaning they cannot use the Speed-2 Movement Tool.

The only way a unit can Move or be placed into BASE CONTACT with an enemy miniature is to Move into Melee. While a unit that has at least one weapon with a 9 is Moving or being placed, it can Move into Melee by Moving or placing that unit's unit leader into BASE CONTACT with an enemy miniature. When a
unit Moves into melee, the following steps must be performed:

If Obi-Wan Kenobi wishes to Move into the same piece of difficult terrain as the Clone Troopers, he will reduce his Speed by 1 to a minimum of 1 and must use the Speed-1 Movement Tool because the Movement Tool will overlap the difficult terrain.

CLIMBING

Sometimes units maneuver onto or through tall pieces of obstacle terrain. This is accomplished by making a Climb. Miniatures on notched bases may not Climb.

To make a Climb, a unit makes a Move as normal, except its Speed becomes 1 during this Move and cannot be increased. A miniature may Move a vertical distance up to height 1 when making a Climb and may place the Movement Tool overlapping obstacle terrain that is up to height 1 taller than the height of any terrain the unit may be on.

EXA MPLEMA: KING ACLIMB

1. After the unit leader of the unit Moving into Melee is placed, place the other miniatures in that unit into BASE CONTACT with enemy miniatures in the unit that their unit leader is now in Melee with.

2.

If the opponent's unit leader is not in BASE CONTACT with an enemy miniature, that miniature's controlling player places it into BASE CONTACT with a miniature in the unit that moved into Melee.

3. The opposing player places the other miniatures in their unit that are not currently in BASE CONTACT with an enemy miniature or are not in Cohesion into BASE CONTACT with miniatures from the enemy unit that Moved into Melee.

If any miniatures cannot be placed into BASE CONTACT with enemy miniatures during this process, they must still be placed in Cohesion. Miniatures may never Move or be placed in such a way that they would be in BASE CONTACT with multiple enemy units, though it is possible for a unit to be in Melee with multiple enemy units if another unit joins the Melee later. 28

Sarah wishes to Move her Clone Trooper unit on top of the building. She measures the height of the building and determines that it is taller than the Clone Trooper's Silhouette, meaning that the Clone Troopers cannot reach the top by making a Standard

EXAMPLE: MOVING INTO MELE E

Will decides that he wants to Move his Clone Trooper unit into Melee with Tony's Battle Droids. Because they have a Melee weapon, the Clone Troopers may Move into BASE CONTACT with the Battle Droids. To do this, Will makes a Move with the Clone Troopers' unit leader that ends with the Clone Troopers' unit leader in BASE CONTACT with 1 of the Battle Droids. Then, ensuring that all of the Clone Troopers remain in Cohesion, Will places the rest of the Clone Troopers so that they are also in BASE CONTACT with the Battle Droids. The unit leader of the Battle Droids is in BASE CONTACT with an enemy miniature, so it does not Move. Tony then places the Battle Droids that are not in BASE CONTACT into base contact with Will's Clone Troopers while maintaining Cohesion. The Clone Troopers and Battle Droids are Engaged and in Melee.

ENGAGED

When two or more Trooper units are in Melee with one another, those units are Engaged. Only Trooper units can be Engaged. An Engaged unit cannot make Moves, make Ranged attacks, and cannot be targeted by Ranged attacks.

WITHDRAW

An Engaged unit may Withdraw during its Activation to leave Melee. To Withdraw, a unit must make a Move action. The unit's Speed becomes 1 during this Move action, before applying effects that increase or reduce speed. A unit with a Speed of 0 cannot Withdraw. A unit cannot Move into Melee during an Activation that it Withdraws. A unit cannot make a Standby action or an attack and Withdraw during the same Activation. 29

ATTACK

LINE OF SIGHT

Attacks are usually made by units as part of an Attack action but can be made as part of another rule. A unit may make multiple attacks a turn but can only make 1 Attack action per turn, regardless of whether the Attack action is a free action.

Line of sight (LOS) is used to see if one miniature can "see" another miniature. A player determines LOS from the perspective of their miniatures. This is done by creating a cylinder rising from the miniature's base called a Silhouette. A miniature's Silhouette includes the miniature's base and the area above it up to the height of the Silhouette. When determining LOS between two miniatures, if an unobstructed straight imaginary line can be drawn from any part of one miniature's Silhouette to any part of the other miniature's Silhouette, those miniatures have LOS to each other.

To DETERMINE the height of a miniature's Silhouette, use the
following rules:

- Trooper units and all their subtypes use a standardized

Silhouette template to DETERMINE LOS. Place the side with the white mark touching the miniature's base, moving the template around if needed. The notched base Trooper Silhouette template is not as wide as a notched base, so it will need to be moved around to measure LOS to various parts of the Silhouette. Miniatures in Trooper units with small bases use the small base Trooper Silhouette template, and miniatures in Trooper units with notched bases use the notched base Trooper Silhouette template. -

Small Base Trooper Silhouette

Notched Base Trooper Silhouette

- Unlike Trooper units, Vehicles do not use Silhouette

templates when determining LOS. To DETERMINE a Vehicles Silhouette, create a cylinder rising from the Vehicle miniature's base all the way to the top of the Vehicle's hulldo not include things like antennas, arms, legs, weapons, or crew members when creating this cylinder. Players should discuss Vehicle Silhouettes before the game begins.

BLOCKING LOS

WEAPONS

Regardless of which Silhouettes are used to DETERMINE LOS, several things may block LOS by preventing an imaginary straight line from being drawn between the Silhouettes of the
two miniatures:

- The Silhouettes of miniatures in Vehicle units block LOS.

For rules on Vehicles, see pg. 40.

- Terrain that the players have determined blocks LOS.

- The Silhouettes of miniatures in Trooper units and all their

subtypes do not block LOS.

- The Silhouettes of Miniatures do not block LOS to or from

other miniatures in the same unit.

TERRAIN BLOCKING LOS

Terrain can block LOS between miniatures by preventing an unobstructed imaginary straight line from being drawn between their Silhouettes. This usually is due to the terrain's size or shape creating a barrier between the two Silhouettes. Additionally, some terrain also blocks LOS due to its nature of being concealing or obscuring-an EXAMPLE of this would be a billowing smokestack, a foggy marsh, or a burning ruin. Terrain like this should be identified by the players before the game begins.

EXAMPLE: DRAWING LINE OF
SIGH T AND BLOC KING LOS

Each unit is equipped with weapons that miniatures may contribute to Attack Pools. Every weapon has a Range and dice it contributes to an Attack Pool when used by a miniature during an attack. Some weapons have keywords associated with them, called weapon keywords. Weapons on Upgrade or COMMAND Cards sometimes have their own surge charts. A weapon with a 9 icon is a Melee weapon, and a weapon with a blue Range icon is a Ranged weapon. A weapon with both a 9 icon and one or more blue Ranged icons can be used as a Melee weapon or a Ranged weapon, chosen when the weapon is added to an Attack Pool-treat the weapon as that type for the duration of the attack sequence.

An Attack Pool that contains Melee weapons is a Melee attack, while an Attack Pool that contains Ranged weapons is a Ranged attack.

BACKUP
When an allied Trooper unit with the p or o Rank is defending against a Ranged attack from an attacking unit whose unit leader is not within 2, the defending unit benefits from Backup if it is within 7 and has LOS to the unit leader of an allied unit that provides Backup. A unit must meet the following REQUIREMENTS to
provide Backup:
-

The unit has the m Rank.

The unit is a Trooper unit.

The unit does not have a number of Suppression TOKENS equal to or greater than its .

The Battle Droids can draw LOS to the Clone Troopers because they can draw an imaginary straight line from their unit leader's Silhouette to at least 1 of the Clone Trooper's Silhouettes.

A unit beneffiting from Backup may cancel up to 2 a results during the Modify Attack Dice step of the attack sequence.

The Battle Droids can draw LOS to Clone Commander Cody because the Silhouette of the Clone Troopers does not block LOS.

DECLARE D EFENDER

The Battle Droids do not have LOS to Obi-Wan Kenobi, because the building blocks all unobstructed straight imaginary line from their unit leader's Silhouette to any part of his Silhouette.

The first stage in the attack sequence is choosing an enemy unit to attack. The attacking player declares they are making an Attack action with their unit against an enemy unit, which becomes the defending unit. Then, measuring from the attacking unit's unit leader, the attacking player checks to see that the defending unit is within Range of at least 1 of the attacking unit's weapons and has at least 1 miniature in LOS of the attacking unit leader. If either of these conditions cannot be met, the attack or Attack action cannot be made. 31

EXA MPLEDECL: ARED EFENDE R

- An Attack Pool cannot contain both Melee and Ranged

weapons.

- An Attack Pool can consist of different weapons.

- All weapons with an identical name must go in the same Attack Pool and cannot be split among multiple Attack Pools.

- An Attack Pool must consist of at least 1 weapon.

After the attacking player is done forming the Attack Pool, they gather all the dice for that Attack Pool and place them on the battlefield next to the defending unit.

Summer has declared an attack with her unit of Battle Droids and ensured that the defending unit of Clone Troopers are in Range and LOS. Next, Summer determines eligible miniatures by checking LOS from each individual Battle Droid in the unit. A miniature is eligible to contribute dice to an Attack Pool if it has LOS to any miniature in the defending unit. Summer determines that all but 1 of Battle Droids are eligible miniatures. Then, for each eligible miniature, Summer chooses 1 of the weapons available to the unit for that miniature to contribute to the Attack Pool. A miniature must meet all REQUIREMENTS, if any, to choose a particular weapon. Finally, Summer cannot choose any weapons if the Clone Troopers would be closer than the weapon's minimum Range or not within the weapon's maximum Range. Since the Clone Troopers are within 2 and Summer has 4 eligible Battle Droids, she decides to add 4 1-3 blaster rifles to the Attack Pool. She gathers the dice for these weapons and places them together on the battlefield next to the defending unit.

ATTACKING IN
MELEE

Miniatures that are not in BASE CONTACT with an enemy miniature can still contribute dice to an Attack Pool with a Melee weapon if they belong to a unit in Melee. A Melee weapon cannot be in the same Attack Pool as a non-Melee weapon.

Sarah has declared an Attack action with her unit of Battle Droids. The first step of the attack sequence is to declare a defender. Measuring from the Battle Droids' unit leader, Sarah chooses an enemy unit that is within Range of at least one of the Battle Droid's weapons and that has at least 1 miniature in LOS. In this case, since the Battle Droids' weapons are 1-3, Sarah must choose an enemy unit within 3 of the Battle Droids' unit leader that is also in LOS. Since the Battle Droid unit leader has LOS to both Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Clone Troopers, and both are within Range of at least 1 of the Battle Droids' weapons, Sarah can choose either as the defending unit.

FORMATTA CKPOOL

The Attack Pool consists of all the attack dice the attacking unit rolls against the defending unit. To form the Attack Pool, the
attacking player makes the following steps:

1. DETERMINE Eligible Miniatures: A miniature in the

attacking unit is eligible to add dice to the Attack Pool if that miniature has LOS to any miniature in the defending unit.

2. Choose Weapons and Gather Dice: For each eligible

miniature, the attacking player may choose up to 1 weapon available to the miniature to add to the Attack Pool, along with any weapon keywords that weapon may have.

- A miniature must meet any REQUIREMENTS to choose a

weapon.

- A miniature may only add a weapon to an Attack Pool once

throughout the entire attack sequence.

- Weapons provided by a , , or  upgrade or

COMMAND Card can only be used by the miniature indicated on the card.

- A weapon cannot be chosen if the defending unit is within a Range less than the weapon's minimum Range or greater than the weapon's maximum Range, as measured from the attacking unit leader to the closest miniature in the defending unit.

- A Ranged weapon cannot be chosen if the defending unit is

in Melee with the attacking unit. 32

Snowtroopers do not have any reroll abilities, but they do have an Aim token. Simone chooses to use the Aim token to reroll up to 2 dice of her choice. Both dice must be rerolled at the same time; she cannot reroll 1 and then reroll it again with the same Aim token. Simone chooses to reroll both Blank dice, getting 1 c and 1 Blank result, bringing the final dice results to 1 b, 1 a, 2 c, and 1 Blank result. Next, she converts attack surges. Since the Snowtroopers have c:a on the surge chart on their Unit Card, Simone changes the 2 c results to a results. If the Snowtroopers did not have c:a, she would have turned the c results to Blank results instead. The final dice results for the attack are therefore 1 b, 3 a, and 1 Blank result.

CANCELING RESULTS

When a result in an Attack Pool is canceled, remove that result from the Attack Pool.

UPGRADING AND
DOWNGRADING DICE

Some effects will instruct players to upgrade or downgrade a unit's attack or defense dice. When a die is upgraded or downgraded, it is removed from the Attack or Defense pool and the corresponding die it was upgraded or downgraded to is added. If the color of a die being upgraded or downgraded is not specified by the effect, the player controlling that effect may choose which dice are upgraded or downgraded. A die cannot be upgraded or downgraded more than once by the same effect.

When upgrading attack dice, a white attack die is upgraded to a black attack die, and a black attack die is upgraded to a red attack die. A red attack die cannot be upgraded.

When downgrading attack dice, a red attack die is downgraded to a black attack die, and a black attack die is downgraded to a white attack die. A white attack die cannot be downgraded.

When upgrading defense dice, a white defense die is upgraded to a red defense die. A red defense die cannot be upgraded.

When downgrading defense dice, a red defense die is downgraded to a white defense die. A white defense die cannot be downgraded.

DECLARE ADDIT IONA LDEFEND ER

If there are any remaining weapons available to a unit that have not been added to an Attack Pool, and there are eligible miniatures that have not yet added a weapon to an Attack Pool, the attacking player may repeat steps 1-2 of the attack sequence, forming a new Attack Pool targeting a different defending enemy unit than any other Attack Pool. Weapons cannot be added to an Attack Pool if a weapon with the same name has already been added to a different Attack Pool.

EXAMPLEDECL: ARE
ADDIT IONAL DEFEN DER

In the previous EXAMPLE, Sarah put all the Clone Troopers' weapons into the same Attack Pool. If she wishes, she may leave the heavy weapon out of the Attack Pool and instead form a pool with only the 4 blaster rifles, leaving an eligible miniature that has not contributed a weapon to an Attack Pool. After she has formed the first Attack Pool, she may then choose to declare a new defender and repeat steps 1-2 of the attack sequence, forming a new Attack Pool with the heavy weapon against a different defending unit.

ROLL ATTACK DICE

The attacking player chooses an Attack Pool and resolves the
following steps in order:

1. Upgrade or Downgrade Attack Dice: Resolve any effects that downgrade 1 or more attack dice in the Attack Pool, starting with the attacker. Then, resolve any effects that upgrade 1 or more Attack dice in the Attack Pool, starting with the attacker.

2. Roll Dice: The attacking player rolls the dice in the

Attack Pool.

3. Reroll Dice: The attacking player can resolve any abilities or spend any Aim TOKENS that allow the attacking unit to reroll attack dice. A unit may spend any number of Aim TOKENS while it is attacking to reroll up to 2 different attack dice for each Aim token spent. If a unit has multiple Aim TOKENS, that unit can choose to spend each Aim token after determining the results of any previous rerolls granted by Aim TOKENS. A unit may reroll the same die multiple times by spending multiple Aim TOKENS, but each die may only be rerolled once per Aim token.

4. Convert Attack Surges: The attacking player changes any c results to the result indicated on the Unit Card. Additonally, the attacking player may spend any number of Surge TOKENS on the attacking unit to convert 1 c result to a a result for every Surge token spent. If no result is indicated, turn the die to a Blank result.

EXAMPLE: ROLL ATTAC KDIC E

Simone has an attacking unit of Snowtroopers with an Attack Pool that consists of 5 white dice. She rolls the dice and gets 1 b, 1 a, 1 c, and 2 Blank results. Having rolled the dice, Simone then resolves any abilities that let her reroll dice. The 33

DETERMINE Number of Obscured Miniatures: If the attack is not a Ranged attack, skip to the Apply Dodge step below. If the attack is a Ranged attack, the attacking player checks LOS from the attacking unit leader to each miniature in the defending unit. If LOS to a miniature is completely blocked, the miniature is obscured. If LOS from any part of the attacking unit leader's Silhouette to any part of the defending miniature's Silhouette is blocked by terrain that the attacking unit leader is not in BASE CONTACT with and that terrain is within 7 of the defending miniature, the defending miniature is obscured. Repeat this process for every miniature in the defending unit.

DETERMINE Cover: If at least half of the miniatures in the defending unit are obscured, the defending unit has Cover. The type of Cover is determined by whatever is obscuring the defending unit, providing either heavy or light Cover based on the players' discussion of terrain before the game. If a unit has Cover and at least 1 of the miniatures in the defending unit is obscured by terrain that provides heavy Cover, the unit has heavy Cover. If the defending unit has Cover but does not have heavy Cover, it has light Cover.

While a unit is Suppressed, it improves its Cover by 1: a unit with no Cover gains Light Cover, and a unit in light cover gains heavy Cover.

Roll Cover Pool: If the defending unit has Cover, the defending player rolls 1 white defense die for every a result in the Attack Pool.

Apply Cover: If the defending unit has light Cover, it cancels 1 a result in the Attack Pool for each d result in the Cover Pool. If the defending unit has heavy Cover, it cancels 1 a result in the Attack Pool for each d and each e result in the Cover Pool instead.

Apply Dodge: If the defending unit has 1 or more Dodge TOKENS, the defending player may spend any number of them. For each Dodge token spent, cancel 1 a result in the Attack Pool. Units may spend Dodge TOKENS even if there are no a results in the Attack Pool.

EXA MPLEAPPL: YING COVER

Summer's Clone Troopers are attacking Brian's unit of 7 Battle Droids with a Ranged attack; she has rolled 1 b and 3 a results. Summer then checks LOS from the Clone Troopers' unit leader to each miniature in the Battle Droid unit. Summer has LOS to every miniature in the Battle Droid unit, but part of the Silhouette of 5 Battle Droids is blocked by terrain. Brian then measures the distance between those Battle Droids and the obscuring terrain. Since 4 of them are at 7 of the obscuring terrain, those 4 miniatures are obscured.

Because at least half of the Battle Droids are obscured, the Battle Droids have Cover. Before the game, Brian and Summer determined that the building provides heavy Cover and the crates provide light Cover. Because at least 1 of the Battle Droids is obscured by the building, the Battle Droids have heavy Cover.

Brian then rolls 3 white defense dice in the Cover Pool, 1 for each a result. Brian rolls 1 Blank result and 2 e results. Because the Battle Droids have heavy Cover, 2 a results are canceled in the attack roll, 1 for each d and e result in the Cover Pool. That leaves 1 b and 1 a result in the Attack Pool.

Brian's Battle Droids do not have any Dodge TOKENS, so the Apply Dodge and Cover step of the attack is over.

MODIF Y ATTAC KDICE

The attacking player may resolve any effects that modify the attacking unit's attack dice. Then the defending player may resolve any effects that modify the attacking unit's attack dice.

ROLL DEFENSE DICE

The defending player rolls defense dice by following the below steps.
1. Gather Defense Dice: For every remaining a and b result remaining in the Attack Pool, the defending player adds 1 defense die to the Defense Pool, using the die pictured on the defending Unit Card.

2. Upgrade or Downgrade Defense Dice: Resolve any effects that downgrade 1 or more defense dice in the Defense Pool, starting with the attacker. Then, resolve any effects that upgrade 1 or more defense dice in the defense roll, starting with the attacker.

3. Roll Defense Dice: Roll all of the defense dice in the

Defense Pool. The result of this roll is the defense roll.

4. Convert Defense Surges: The defending player changes any e results to the result indicated on the Unit Card. If no result is indicated, turn the die to a Blank result. The defending player may spend any number of Surge TOKENS on the defending unit to convert 1 e result to a d result for each Surge token spent.

EXAMPLE: ROLLING DEFENSE DICE

Summer has attacked Brian's Battle Droids and has an Attack Pool of 1 b and 1 a result after applying Dodge and Cover. Since Battle Droids have white defense dice, Brian rolls 2 white defense dice, 1 for each a and b result remaining. He rolls 1 d and 1 e result.

After rolling defense dice, Brian may use any abilities that allow him to reroll defense dice. The Battle Droids do not have such an ability, so he proceeds to convert defense surges. Since Battle Droids do not have e:d on their Unit Card, he changes the e he rolled to a Blank, resulting in a final roll of 1 d and 1 Blank result. 34

MODIFY DEFENSE DICE

The defending player may resolve any effects that modify the defending unit's defense dice. Then the attacking player may resolve any effects that modify the defending unit's defense dice.

COMPARE RESULTS
The attacking player counts the number of a and b results. Then the defending player counts the number of d results and subtracts the total number of d results from the total number of a and b results. The defending unit suffers a number of Wounds equal to the difference.

EXAMPLECOMP: ARING RESULTS
Summer has rolled 1 b and 1 a result after applying Cover in her attack against Brian's Battle Droids, and he has rolled 1 d and 1 Blank result in defense. Summer counts her a and b results for a total of 2. Brian counts his d results for a total of 1. The players subtract Brian's total from Summer's total for 2-1=1. Since the defending unit suffers a number of Wounds equal to the difference in the attacking and defending results, Brian's Battle Droids suffer 1 Wound.

SUFFE RING W OUND S AND
DEFEAT INGM INIAT URES

When a player's unit suffers Wounds, that player chooses a miniature from that unit and assigns Wound TOKENS to it until either all Wounds have been suffered or the miniature is defeated.

A miniature is defeated when it has a number of Wound TOKENS assigned to it equal to its Wound threshold. If there are unassigned Wounds remaining after a miniature has been defeated, the player chooses another miniature from the same unit and repeats the process until either all Wounds have been assigned or all miniatures in the unit have been defeated. When a unit suffers Wounds from a Ranged attack, if the attacker has LOS to only some of the miniatures in the defending unit, the defending unit cannot suffer Wounds greater than the total Wound threshold of miniatures that are in LOS.

A unit leader cannot be assigned Wounds unless it is the only miniature in the unit.

A miniature or unit with at least 1 Wound token is Wounded. When assigning Wound TOKENS, the Wounded miniature with the most Wound TOKENS must be chosen before any others when assigning Wounds and must be assigned Wounds until it is defeated. If more than 1 miniature has the same number of Wound TOKENS assigned, choose 1 of those miniatures to assign Wounds to.

When a miniature is defeated, remove it from the battlefield. If a unit leader is defeated and there are still undefeated miniatures in the unit, the unit's controlling player must immediately choose another miniature in that unit to become the unit leader, replacing that miniature with the unit leader miniature.

When all of the miniatures in a unit are defeated, the unit is defeated. Remove all Order TOKENS for that unit from the battlefield.

REMOVING
MINIATURES IN
MELEE

When miniatures in Melee are defeated, space may be created for the attacking miniatures to advance. After the attack is resolved, the attacking player performs the
following steps to place their miniatures back into Melee:

1. That player places each allied unit leader miniature that is no longer in BASE CONTACT with any enemy miniatures into BASE CONTACT with an enemy unit their unit was in Melee with before the attack was resolved.

2. That player places each allied miniature that is not in Cohesion or no longer in BASE CONTACT with an enemy miniature into Cohesion and into BASE CONTACT with an enemy unit their unit was in Melee with before the attack was resolved.

Then the defending player performs the steps above. If any miniature cannot be placed into BASE CONTACT with an enemy miniature during this process, they must still be placed into Cohesion.

If, for any reason, miniatures cannot be placed back into BASE CONTACT with an enemy miniature and none of the miniatures belonging to that unit are in BASE CONTACT with an enemy miniature, those miniatures do not move and that unit is no longer in Melee.

EFFECTS THATDEAL
OR ASSIGN WOUNDS

Some effects deal or assign Wounds without going through the attack sequence. These effects are not attacks, so no defense dice are rolled, nor are any Suppression TOKENS assigned. The player that controls the unit suffering Wounds assigns the Wounds as normal.

Some effects explicitly state that a certain miniature in a unit suffers Wounds. In this case, the player who controls the effect may assign any Wounds suffered in this way, ignoring the normal rules for assigning Wounds. 35

EXA MPLEASS: IGNING WOUNDS
AND DEFEATING M INIATU RES

After comparing results, Dallas' unit of 5 Clone Troopers has suffered 3 Wounds from an attack. He then assigns 1 of the Wounds to a miniature in the unit. Since all the miniatures in the Clone Trooper unit have a Wound threshold of 1, the miniature that Dallas assigned a Wound to is defeated. Since there are 2 unassigned Wounds remaining, Dallas chooses another miniature from the same unit and repeats the process until either all Wounds have been suffered or all miniatures in the unit have been defeated. Since each Clone Trooper only has a Wound threshold of 1 and the unit suffered 3 Wounds, this means that 3 Clone Troopers are defeated, leaving 2 Clone Troopers remaining.

After comparing results, Chris' unit of 3 unwounded Wookiees has suffered 4 Wounds. He then assigns 1 of the Wounds to a miniature in the unit. Because Wookiees have a Wound threshold of 3, the Wookiee is not defeated when it is assigned the Wound, and Chris has 3 more Wounds left to assign. However, because the Wookiee has at least 1 Wound token assigned to it, it is Wounded, and Chris MUST choose to assign it any additional Wound TOKENS since it has more Wound TOKENS assigned to it than any other miniature in the unit. Chris is forced to assign the next 2 Wounds to that Wookiee until it reaches its Wound threshold of 3 and is defeated, leaving 1 Wound left to be assigned. Chris must choose a non-unit leader Wookiee to assign the Wound to. In the future, because the Wounded Wookiee has more Wound TOKENS than the others, Chris must assign Wounds to it first, and must continue to do so until it is defeated.

DEFENDE R

After RESOLVING steps 1-9 of the attack sequence, if there were any a or b results in the Attack Pool during the Roll Attack Dice step of the attack sequence and the attack was a Ranged attack, if the defending unit was not defeated, it gains 1 Suppression token.

CHOOSE ADDITI ONALATTA CK
POOL

After RESOLVING steps 1-10 of the attack sequence, if the attacking unit still has Attack Pools to resolve, the attacking player chooses another Attack Pool to resolve against a defending unit, making an attack against it by repeating steps 4-11 of the attack sequence.

Once all of an attacking unit's Attack Pools have been resolved, the Attack action ends.

FULLATT ACK SEQUENCE EXAMPLE

Simone has declared an Attack action with her unit of Snowtroopers. The first step of the attack sequence is to declare a defender. Measuring from the Snowtroopers' unit leader, Simone chooses an enemy unit that is in Range of at least 1 of the Snowtrooper's weapons and that has at least 1 miniature in LOS. In this case, since the maximum Range on the Snowtrooper's

weapons is 3, Simone must choose an enemy unit within 3 of the Snowtrooper unit leader that is also in LOS. The Snowtroopers cannot see Luke Skywalker because they do not have LOS to him. Instead, Simone declares the Rebel Troopers as the defending unit, as they are within 3 of the Snowtroopers unit leader and are in
LOS.

Next, Simone determines eligible miniatures by checking LOS from each individual Snowtrooper in the attacking unit. A miniature is eligible to contribute dice to an Attack Pool if it has LOS to any miniature in the defending unit. Simone determines that all but 1 of the Snowtroopers are eligible miniatures. Then, for each eligible miniature, Simone chooses 1 of the weapons available to the unit for that miniature to contribute to the Attack Pool. A miniature must meet all REQUIREMENTS, if any, to choose a particular weapon. Finally, Simone cannot choose any weapons if the Rebel Troopers would be closer than the weapon's minimum Range or not within the weapon's maximum Range. Since the Rebel Troopers are within 3 and Simone has 5 eligible Snowtroopers, Simone decides to add 5 1-3 blaster rifles to the Attack Pool. Simone gathers the dice for these weapons and places them together on the battlefield next to the defending unit.

The Attack Pool consists of 5 white dice. Simone rolls the attack dice and gets 1 b, 1 a, 1 c, and 2 Blank results. Having rolled the dice, Simone then resolves any abilities that let her reroll dice. The Snowtroopers do not have any reroll abilities, but they do have an Aim token. Simone chooses to use the Aim token to reroll up to 2 dice of her choice. Both dice must be rerolled at the same time, she cannot reroll 1 and then reroll it again with the same Aim token. Simone chooses to reroll both Blank dice, getting 2 c results, bringing the final dice results to 1 b, 1 a, and 3 c results. Next, she converts attack surges. Since the Snowtroopers have c:a on their Unit Card, Simone changes the 3 c results to a results. If the Snowtroopers did not have c:a, she would have turned the c results to Blank results instead. The final dice results for the attack are therefore 1 b and 4 a results.

The next step of the attack is to Apply Dodge and Cover. To do so, Simone checks LOS from the Snowtrooper's unit leader to each miniature in the Rebel Trooper unit. If LOS to any part of a Rebel Trooper's Silhouette is blocked by terrain that the Snowtroopers' unit leader is not in BASE CONTACT with, and that terrain is within 7 of that Rebel Trooper, it is obscured. Simone checks LOS and determines that 5 Rebel Troopers are obscured.

Because at least half of the Rebel Troopers are obscured, the Rebel Troopers have Cover. Before the game, Will and Simone determined that the crates provide light Cover. Because over half of the Rebel Troopers are obscured by the crates, the Rebel Troopers count as having light Cover.

Will then rolls 4 white defense dice in the Cover Pool, 1 for each a result. Will rolls 2 Blank results, 1 e result, and 1 d result. Because the Rebel Troopers have light Cover, 1 a result is canceled for each d result in the Cover Pool. Will only rolled 1 d result, so he cancels 1 a result in Simone's dice roll, leaving the Attack Pool at 1 b and 3 a results. 36

Will's Rebel Troopers do not have any Dodge TOKENS, so the attack moves to the next step.

Since Rebel Troopers have white defense dice, Will rolls 4 white defense dice, 1 for each a and b result remaining. He rolls 1 d, 1 e, and 2 Blank results.

After rolling defense dice, Will may use any abilities that allow him to reroll defense dice. The Rebel Troopers do not have such an ability, so he proceeds to convert defense surges. Since Rebel Troopers have e:d on their Unit Card, he changes the e he rolled to a d, resulting in a final roll of 2 d and 2 Blank results. Simone has rolled 1 b and 3 a results after applying Cover in her attack against Will's Rebel Troopers, and he has rolled 2 d and 2 Blank results in defense. Simone counts her a and b results, for a total of 4. Will counts his d results for a total of 2. The players subtract Will's total from Simone's total for 4-2=2. Since the defending unit suffers a number of Wounds equal to the difference in the attacking and defending results, Will's Rebel Troopers suffer 2 Wounds.

Will must now assign the Wounds to miniatures in the Rebel Trooper unit. Since all the miniatures in the Rebel Trooper unit have a Wound threshold of 1, each miniature that Will assigns a Wound to is defeated. Will chooses a Rebel Trooper to assign the Wound to, and that miniature is defeated. There is still 1 unassigned Wound remaining, so Will chooses another miniature from the same unit and repeats the process until either all Wounds have been suffered or all miniatures in the unit have been defeated. Since each Rebel Trooper only has a Wound threshold of 1 and the unit suffered 2 Wounds, 2 Rebel Troopers are defeated, leaving 3 Rebel Troopers left. Because there were a or b results in the Attack Pool during the Roll Attack Dice step of the attack sequence, and the attack was a Ranged attack, the Rebel Trooper unit gains 1 Suppression token.

STANDBY

A Trooper or Ground Vehicle unit can make the Standby action to gain 1 Standby token. Place it on the battlefield near the unit's unit leader. A unit cannot make an Attack action and a Standby action in the same Activation. A unit can only have 1 Standby token at a time.

During the Activation Phase, after an enemy unit within 2 and in LOS of any miniature in an allied Trooper or allied Ground Vehicle unit with a Standby token makes an attack, Move, or action, if it is not that allied unit's Activation and that attack, Move, or action was not caused by an effect of that allied unit's controlling player, that allied unit may spend a Standby token to make a free Move action or a free Attack action. The only unit that can be declared as a defender during a free Attack action made in this way is the enemy unit that made the attack,

Move, or action that triggered the Standby.

If a unit makes a Move, an attack, an action, or gains 1 or more Suppression TOKENS, it removes any Standby TOKENS it has.

A Standby token is spent before any effects that trigger after an attack, Attack action, Move, or Move action is resolved. A unit cannot spend a Standby token until all of an attacking unit's Attack Pools have been resolved.

EXAMPLE: STANDBY

Melissa's Battle Droid unit makes the Standby action and gains a Standby token. Later in the round, the enemy Clone Trooper unit activates and makes an action. Because the Clone Trooper unit is within 2 of the Battle Droids and in LOS, after the action is complete the Battle Droids may spend their Standby token to make a free Move or Attack action after the Clone Trooper's action is resolved.

PLACE ORDE R TO KEN

Once the active player has resolved any end of unit Activation effects, if the unit has a faceup Order token, flip it facedown or assign it the drawn Order token facedown. The unit's Activation and active player's Turn have ended, and the other player becomes the active player. They take their Turn, repeating steps 2-3 of the Activation Phase. 37

RESOLVE END OF ACTIVATI ON
PHASE EFFECTS

When all units on the battlefield have been activated, both players' Order Pools are empty, and neither player has Order TOKENS on COMMAND Cards, resolve any effects that occur at the end of the Activation Phase.

Once any end of Activation Phase effects have been resolved, the Activation Phase is over and players proceed to the End Phase.

THE END PHASE

During the End Phase, players prepare for the next Round by scoring VPs, discarding COMMAND Cards, removing certain types of TOKENS, updating the Order Pool, RESOLVING any effects, and advancing the Round counter.

PARTS OF THE
END PHASE

PROMOTE
If all of a player's p units are defeated, and they do not control a unit with the Field Commander keyword with a Commander token, starting with the player with priority, players must promote a Trooper unit to change its Rank and become a p unit. The unit's original Order token is discarded and is replaced by a p Order token. The unit counts as a p unit for all rules purposes. If a player has no Trooper units to promote and does not control a unit with the Field Commander keyword with a Commander token, then they no longer have a p unit and cannot play COMMAND Cards.

EXAMPLEPR: OMOTE
Earlier in the Round, the last p unit in Josh's army was defeated. At the Update Order Pool and Promote step of the End Phase, he must choose a Trooper unit to become a p. The unit's original Order token is discarded, and he replaces it with a p Order token. The promoted unit counts as a p for all rules purposes. If Josh doesn't have any Trooper units to promote, then he no longer has a p and cannot play COMMAND Cards for the rest of the game.

APPENDIX A: NOTCHED
BASE S

APPENDIX B: UNIT
TYPES

Some miniatures in Star Wars: Legion have notched bases. Units on notched bases follow all of the rules detailed in this section.

Each unit in Star Wars: Legion has a unit type indicated on their Unit Card. All units are either Troopers or Vehicles, and each type has a number of subtypes with their own special rules.

MOVING WITHNOTCHEDBA SES

Miniatures with notched bases have a number of additional
movement options available to them:

PIVO T

Some miniatures that have notched bases can Pivot. If a unit can Pivot, it is noted in the rules for its unit type.

When a unit that can Pivot makes a Move action, it may choose to Pivot instead of making another movement. To Pivot, rotate the unit leader's base up to 90° to the left or right, keeping the center of the base in the same place. If a unit contains multiple miniatures, each miniature in the unit must Pivot so that the directional orientation of its base is the same as the unit leader's.

TROOPER

Trooper is the most common unit type in Star Wars: Legion. Trooper units may have the following subtypes, each with their
own additional rules:

- Clone Trooper

- Creature Trooper

- Droid Trooper

- Emplacement Trooper

- Wookiee Trooper

Rules that affect a Trooper unit affect all its subtypes. Subtypes must follow all the rules of normal Trooper Units unless otherwise stated.

CLONE TROOPER

- While attacking or defending, a Clone Trooper unit may spend 1 Aim, Dodge, or Surge token belonging to another allied Clone Trooper unit within 2 and in LOS as if the attacking or defending unit had that token.

REVERS E MOVES

CREATURETR OOPER

Some miniatures on notched bases can Reverse. Only certain unit types may make Reverse Moves.

When a unit makes a Move action, it may choose to make a Reverse Move instead of making another movement. A Reverse Move is a normal notched base Standard Move, with the
following exceptions:

- When making a partial Reverse Move, instead of placing the Movement Tool wholly in the front notch of the unit leader's base at the start of the Move, place the Movement Tool wholly in the rear notch.

- When making a full Reverse Move, instead of placing the

Movement Tool in the front notch of the unit leader's base, place it in the rear notch. Then place the front notch of the unit leader's base on the other end of the Movement Tool.

- Creature Troopers have notched bases.

- Creature Troopers can make Reverse Moves.

- Creature Troopers can Pivot, even while they are Engaged.

- Creature Troopers do not receive Cover from barricades.

- Creature Troopers can attack and Withdraw during the

same Activation.

DROIDTROO PER

- Droid Troopers cannot be Suppressed, though they can still

be Panicked.

- Droid Troopers cannot gain or resolve Poison TOKENS.

EMPLACEMENT T ROOPER

- While making a Reverse Move, a unit reduces its Speed by 1

to a minimum of 1.

- Emplacement Troopers have notched bases.

ATTACKING WITHNOTC HEDBAS ES

- Emplacement Troopers can make Reverse Moves.

Miniatures with notched bases have four different arcs represented by lines sculpted on their bases: front, two sides, and rear. These arcs are referenced by certain rules, such as the Fixed and Weak Point keywords.

- Emplacement Troopers can Pivot, even while they

are Engaged. 39

WOOKIEE TROOPER

- Wookiee Troopers have no additional special rules, other

than being referenced by their unit type for certain rules and abilities.

VEHIC LES

- Ground Vehicles can end a Move with some part of their

base partially overlapping terrain.

- A Ground Vehicle may not end a Move or be placed in a

position where the miniature would be physically unstable or fall over, or cause the angle of the miniature's base to be greater than 45°.

There are many types of vehicles in Star Wars: Legion, from lumbering tanks to soaring airspeeders and everything in between. Every Vehicle unit in Star Wars: Legion also has one of
the subtypes listed below with their own special rules:

- Ground Vehicles can be in Melee but cannot be Engaged.

- Ground Vehicles block LOS as if they were a piece of area

terrain consisting of the volume of their Silhouette.

- When determining the number of obscured miniatures and determining Cover during an attack sequence, treat Ground Vehicles as a piece of area terrain consisting of the volume of their Silhouette that provides heavy Cover.

- When a Ground Vehicle is defending against a Ranged attack, during the Apply Dodge and Cover step, it cannot be obscured and cannot have Cover as a result of being obscured.

R EPULSORVE HICLES

- Repulsor Vehicles have notched bases.

- Repulsor Vehicles can Pivot.

- Repulsor Vehicles cannot make the Standby action or gain

or spend Standby TOKENS.

- Repulsor Vehicles can end a Move with part of their base

partially overlapping terrain.

- Repulsor Vehicles may Move onto or through impassable terrain and may place the Movement Tool overlapping impassable terrain when doing so.

- A Repulsor Vehicle may not end a Move or be placed in a position where the miniature would be physically unstable or fall over, or cause the angle of the miniature's base to be greater than 45°.

- Repulsor Vehicles can be in Melee but cannot be Engaged.

- Repulsor Vehicles do not block LOS, do not obscure

miniatures, and do not provide Cover.

- When a Repulsor Vehicle is defending against a Ranged attack, during the Apply Dodge and Cover step, it cannot be obscured and cannot have Cover as a result of being obscured.

- Ground Vehicle

- Repulsor Vehicle

Rules that affect a Vehicle unit affect all its subtypes unless otherwise stated. Regardless of subtype, all Vehicles have the Resiliency rules listed below.

RESILI ENCY
Vehicles do not have a . Instead most, but not all, have a Resilience value. A Vehicle that does not have a Resilience value has a "-" on its Unit Card where the Resilience value should be.

When a Vehicle with a Resilience value has a number of Wounds equal to or more than its Resilience value, after the effect causing this is resolved, the Vehicle gains a Vehicle Damage token.

When a player activates a Vehicle unit with a Vehicle Damage token, roll 1 white defense die. On a Blank result that Vehicle makes 1 fewer action during its Activation.

A Vehicle can only have 1 Vehicle Damage token at a time and can only gain a Vehicle Damage token in this way once per game.

EXA MPLEVE: HICLE DAMAGE

Nicholas' AAT Tank has already suffered 3 Wounds and suffers 3 more from an attack. After the attack is resolved, Nicholas' AAT Tank gains a Vehicle Damage token.

Because a Vehicle can only ever gain a Vehicle Damage token when it has Wounds equal to its Resilience once per game, if Nicholas removes the Vehicle Damage token from his AAT Tank and it suffers further Wounds, he does not gain another Vehicle Damage token.

GROUNDVEHICLES

- Ground Vehicles have notched bases.

- Ground Vehicles can Pivot and make Reverse Moves. 40

APPENDIX C:
MERC ENARIES AND
BATTLE FORCES

MERC ENARIES

The Star Wars galaxy is populated with all manner of heroes, villains, rogues, organizations, and even entire forces unaligned with the galaxy's major power structures. These characters and forces appear in Star Wars: Legion as Mercenary units.

Mercenary units are not loyal to any of the game's Factions. However, Factions and some Battle Forces can hire certain Mercenary units and field them in their armies. The Unit Card of a Mercenary unit indicates each Faction that can include that Mercenary unit in an army. There is no additional cost to fielding a Mercenary unit in an army.

Mercenary units do not count toward the minimum number of Ranks required in an army, but they do count toward the maximum Ranks allowed. An army may include only 2 Mercenary units of the m Rank and only 1 Mercenary unit of each other Rank. For more information on Rank REQUIREMENTS, see pg. 16.

EXAMPLEMERC: ENARIES AND
RANK REQUI REMENT S

For EXAMPLE, a standard Galactic Empire army that includes 1 or more Black Sun Enforcers units must field at least 3 non- Mercenary m units and cannot field a combined number of m units greater than 6.

A player cannot normally field an army that contains only Mercenary units, but some Battle Forces allow a player to do just that. These Battle Forces have their own unique REQUIREMENTS and rules. Some Mercenary units cannot be used by any Faction; these units can only be used when special rules allow them to be included in armies.

A Mercenary unit is allied to the other units in its army but is not considered part of that army's Faction. When including Mercenary units in an army, use Order TOKENS with a back that corresponds to the Faction of the army. Players fielding an army that includes only Mercenary units use the Mercenary Order TOKENS.

EXAMPLEMERC: ENARIES AND
FACTI ONS

For EXAMPLE, Black Sun Enforcers in a Galactic Empire army are allied to other units in the army but are not part of the Galactic Empire Faction. Black Sun Enforcers in a Galactic Empire army would use Galactic Empire Order TOKENS.

AFFIL IATION S

Every Mercenary unit has an Affiliation. Their Affiliation is where their true loyalty lies. Affiliations represent criminal organizations, syndicates, guilds, gangs, or even a lone bounty

hunter just looking out for themselves. A unit's Affiliation is represented by an icon in the upper left corner of their Unit Card, where a unit's Faction icon would normally be.

A unit with an Affiliation can be issued orders only by an allied unit that has the same Affiliation.

AFF ILIATION ICONS

Each Affiliation is represented by an icon. The Affiliations
found in Star Wars: Legion are as follows:

 Black Sun x The Pyke Syndicate z Raiders y Rogues  Maul Loyalists  Ewoks

BATTL EFORCE S

In Star Wars: Legion, Battle Forces represent groups of units that fought side by side in the Star Wars galaxy. These forces are themed around unique sub-groups and can range from a ragtag group of Mercenaries to the main invasion force of the Empire.

Battle Forces provide players with an alternative way to build and field an army. Each Battle Force has its own list of specific units that it is allowed to field, its own Rank REQUIREMENTS for both standard and Recon armies, and its own special rules, which may affect how that Battle Force is built, set up, or plays.
