COUNTE RPART

Some units are faithful companions or subservient minions and are almost never seen apart from another unit.

That miniature has a Counterpart Card and their miniature is a Counterpart miniature.

Sometimes, a Counterpart Card has a different unit type only for the purposes of equipping Upgrade Cards.

- A unit leader in a combined unit can be assigned Wounds when it is the only non-Counterpart miniature in the unit.

- When a Wound token would be assigned to a non-

Each unit with the Detachment keyword needs its own matching specified unit. Additionally, during the Deploy in Prepared Positions step, a unit with the Detachment keyword gains the Infiltrate or Prepared Position keyword for the remainder of the game if its matching specified unit has that keyword.

For EXAMPLE, a player wishes to add a DF-90 Mortar Trooper to their army. Because the DF-90 Mortar Trooper has the Detachment: Shoretroopers keyword, the player must first add a unit of Shoretroopers to their army before adding the DF-90 Mortar Trooper. The player does so, and the army now contains a Shoretroopers unit and a DF-90 Mortar Trooper unit. The player then wishes to add a second DF-90 Mortar Trooper unit to their army, and therefore must first select a second unit of Shoretroopers to include in their army.

When a unit with the Deflect keyword uses the Guardian X keyword, before converting any defense surges, the attacker suffers 1 Wound if at least 1 of the dice rolled with Guardian X rolled at least 1 e result.

If the Deflect keyword causes the attacking unit to be defeated, the attack continues, and the defender can still suffer Wounds.

As a Free Card action, a unit with the Distract keyword can choose an enemy Trooper unit within 2 and in LOS. Until the end of the Round, when the chosen enemy unit makes an attack, it must attack the unit that used the Distract action, if able.

During Army Building, for each unit a player includes with the Entourage keyword, 1 unit specified by the Entourage keyword does not count its Rank towards the maximum Rank REQUIREMENTS for that Rank. This can allow a player to bring more units of a specific Rank than Rank REQUIREMENTS allow.

In the COMMAND Phase, during the Issue Orders step, a unit with the Entourage keyword may issue an Order to an allied unit within 2 that has the name specified by the Entourage keyword.

Additionally, the unit specified by the Entourage keyword ignores the m Rank requirement to provide Backup to the unit with the Entourage keyword.

During Army Building, an army that includes a unit with the Field Commander keyword may ignore the minimum p Rank requirement. If a player's army contains no p units during Setup but does contain a unit with the Field Commander keyword, that unit gains a Commander token. When a player reveals a non-p or o specific COMMAND Card, they may nominate an allied unit with the Field Commander keyword to be Commander and issue Orders. A unit with the Field Commander keyword is not a p and only counts as one for the purposes of issuing Orders with a COMMAND Card during the COMMAND Phase.

A defending unit that has the Guardian X keyword used on it gains a Suppression token as normal.

A unit cannot use Guardian X if the defending unit also has the Guardian X keyword. If multiple allied units can use the Guardian X keyword during an attack, the player who controls those units declares which unit is using the Guardian X keyword and resolves their ability before choosing whether to declare that another unit is using the Guardian X keyword.

A unit cannot use Guardian X if it has a number of Suppression TOKENS equal to or greater than its . The Pierce X keyword can be used to cancel block d results on defense dice rolled by a unit using Guardian X; treat canceled block d results as Blank results.

During Setup, each unit with the Scouting Party keyword may choose up to X allied Trooper units that do not have the Scout keyword that share the same Faction or Affiliation as the Scouting Party unit. Each chosen unit gains the Scout X keyword, where X is the Scout X value of the unit with the Scouting Party keyword.

SECRET MISSION

At the beginning of each COMMAND Phase, if a unit with the Secret Mission keyword is completely within enemy Territory, it gains 1 Secret Mission token. A unit may only ever gain 1 Secret Mission token per game.

A unit may make a Self-Destruct X Card action only if it has a number of Wound TOKENS equal to or greater than half of its Wound threshold, rounding up. For each unit within 1 and in LOS, roll X black attack dice, completely RESOLVING each roll before moving to the next unit. That unit suffers 1 Wound for each c and b result rolled, then gains 1 Suppression token for each a result rolled. After all rolls are resolved, this unit is defeated.

SELF-PRE SERVATION
A unit with the Self-Preservation keyword cannot use the  of units that are not of the same Affiliation when checking for Panic.

SENTINEL

A unit with the Sentinel keyword can spend a Standby token after an enemy unit makes an attack, Move, or action within 3, rather than within 2.

SHARPSH OOTE RX

During the DETERMINE Cover step, a unit with the Sharpshooter X keyword subtracts X from the numerical value of the defender's Cover.

For EXAMPLE, a unit with heavy Cover and 1 Suppression token that is attacked by a unit with Sharpshooter 1 has light Cover.

SHIEL DEDX

A unit with the Shielded X keyword has X Shield TOKENS. Shield TOKENS belong to the unit and are not assigned to individual miniatures. If a unit gains the Shielded X keyword, it gains X Shield TOKENS. Similarly, if a unit loses the Shielded X keyword it loses X Shield TOKENS.

Shield TOKENS are double-sided, with an active side and an inactive side, and always enter play with their active side faceup placed on the battlefield next to the unit that has those Shield TOKENS. When a unit flips an active Shield token, that Shield token is flipped to its inactive side and is now inactive. When a unit flips an inactive Shield token, that Shield token is flipped to its active side and is now active.

While defending against a Ranged attack, a defending unit may flip any number of its active Shield TOKENS to their inactive side during the Modify Attack Dice step to cancel 1 hit a or 1 critical b result for each Shield token flipped in this way. 54

S HIEN MASTERY

When a unit with the Shien Mastery keyword uses the Deflect keyword, the attacker suffers 1 Wound for each e result in the defense roll instead of any other Wounds Deflect would cause. Additionally, when a unit with the Shien Mastery keyword is the defending unit of a Ranged attack, if it does not suffer Wounds from that attack, it does not gain Suppression TOKENS during the Assign Suppression Token to Defender step of that attack.

S MOKE X

A unit that has the Smoke X keyword can make the Smoke X action to place X Smoke TOKENS comepletely within 1 and in LOS of its unit leader.

Smoke TOKENS cannot overlap any Objective, Advantage, Charge, or other Smoke TOKENS and must be placed on a flat surface.

SMOKE TOKENS
Trooper units whose unit leader is within 1 of a Smoke token improve the numerical value of their Cover by 1 during the DETERMINE Cover step. While a Trooper unit is attacking, if the attacking unit leader is within 1 of a Smoke token, the defending unit improves the numerical value of their Cover by 1. Effects that improve a unit's Cover are cumulative. A unit cannot be affected by the same Smoke token more than once. Smoke TOKENS are removed during the Remove TOKENS step of the End Phase. For EXAMPLE, a Trooper unit whose unit leader is within 1 of 2 Smoke TOKENS would improve the numerical value of its Cover by 2.

S PECIAL ISSUE: BATTLE
FORC E

A unit with the Special Issue keyword can only be included in an army using the specified Battle Force.

S ORESU MASTERY

When a unit with Soresu Mastery defends against a Ranged attack, it may reroll all of its defense dice during the Reroll Defense Dice step. Additionally, when a unit with Soresu Mastery is using the Guardian X keyword, it may spend 1 Dodge token before converting any e results. If it does, it rerolls all its defense dice before converting e results. Each die cannot be rerolled more than once using Soresu Mastery.

S PEEDER X

A unit with the Speeder X keyword can Move over or end its movement on terrain equal to or less than height X. Additionally, when a unit with the Speeder X keyword on notched bases makes a Move, it skips step 1 of notched base movement.

A unit with the Speeder X keyword must make a free compulsory Move action at the start or end of its Make Actions step.

If a unit with the Speeder X keyword makes more than 1 non-compulsory Move action during its Activation, it may not claim Asset TOKENS that Activation. Additionally, a unit with the Speeder X keyword that has claimed an Asset token can make only 1 non-compulsory Move action during its Activation.

COMPULSOR Y MOVE

A compulsory Move is a free Move action. To make a compulsory Move, the unit makes a full Move at its Speed. If it cannot do so, or if a full Move would cause any part of the unit leader's base to be outside the battlefield, it can make a partial Move instead, ending its movement as far along the Movement Tool as possible.

SPOTTE RX

As a Card or Free Card action, a unit with the Spotter X keyword can choose up to X allied units within 2. Each chosen unit gains 1 Aim token.

SPUR

When a unit with the Spur keyword makes a Move, its controlling player may assign it 1 Suppression token. If they do, that unit increases its Speed by 1 during that Move to a maximum of 3. When a unit makes a Move, apply any effects that increase the unit's Speed before applying any effects that reduce that unit's Speed.

For EXAMPLE, a unit that normally has a Speed of 1, but has 1 Immobilize token, can use the Spur keyword to make a Move with a total Speed of 1. However, a unit that normally has a Speed of 1, but has 2 Immobilize TOKENS, cannot use the Spur keyword to make a Move because its Speed would still be 0.

STATIO NARY

A unit with the Stationary keyword cannot make Moves unless the Move is a Pivot. A unit with the Prepared Position and Stationary keywords must Deploy during the Deploy in Prepared Positions step of Setup.

STEAD Y

After a unit that has the Steady keyword makes a Move action during its Activation, it may make a free Attack action. Only Ranged weapons can be added to Attack Pools during this Attack action.

TARGET X

After a unit with the Target X keyword is issued an Order, it gains X Aim TOKENS.

TEMP TED

If an allied unit is defeated by an enemy attack and the attacking unit is within 3 of a unit with the Tempted keyword, after the attack is resolved, that unit with the Tempted keyword may make a free Attack action or a Speed-2 Move ignoring difficult terrain. A unit may use the Tempted keyword only once each Round.

A unit with the Unstoppable keyword is eligible to activate during the Activation Phase while it has 1 or fewer Order TOKENS. This unit may never have more than 1 faceup Order token. While this unit is not defeated, when its controlling player is creating their Order Pool, they add an additional Order token corresponding to this unit's Rank to their Order Pool.

WEAKPOIN T XFRONT: /RE AR/
SIDES

While a unit with the Weak Point X: Front/Rear/Sides keyword defends, if the attacking unit's unit leader is at least partially inside the specified firing arc of the defending unit, the Attack Pool gains the Impact X keyword where X is equal to the value of Weak Point X.

While a unit with the Weak Point X keyword defends against a Ranged attack made by an area weapon, treat the Charge token or Advantage token as the attacking unit leader.

WEIGHE DDOW N

A unit with the Weighed Down keyword cannot use the Jump keyword while it is holding 1 or more Objective TOKENS,

TRAN S PORT

W ERENO' T REGS

During Setup, a unit with the Transport keyword may choose an allied m Trooper or n Trooper unit to transport. During the first Round's Issue Orders step, a unit with the Transport keyword may issue an Order to the chosen unit. If the chosen unit is undeployed when the unit with the Transport keyword Deploys, after the effect is resolved, the chosen unit Deploys by making a Speed-1 Move. Measure the start of this Move with both prongs of one side of the Movement Tool touching the base of the unit with the Transport keyword. A unit can make this Move regardless of its Speed. When the chosen unit Deploys in this way, the unit leader of that unit measures the vertical distance changed during that Move starting from the unit with the Transport keyword.

UNCANNY LUCK X

While a unit with the Uncanny Luck X keyword defends, it may reroll up to X defense dice during the Reroll Defense Dice step. Any dice rerolled with the Uncanny Luck X keyword must be rerolled at the same time, and each die cannot be rerolled more than once.

UNCONCER NED
A unit with the Unconcerned keyword cannot benefit from Cover, and miniatures in the unit cannot be Repaired or Restored.

A unit with the We're Not Regs keyword cannot spend Green TOKENS on other Clone Trooper units, and other Clone Trooper units cannot spend this unit's Green TOKENS. Additionally, this unit cannot benefit from Backup.

WHEELMO DE

At the start of its Activation, a unit with the Wheel Mode keyword can increase its Speed to 3 until the end of that Activation. If it does, until the end of the Round, it gains the Cover 2 keyword and cannot attack or flip active Shield TOKENS.

To indicate that a unit of Droidekas is using the Wheel Mode keyword, a player may replace their standing Droideka miniatures with ball-form Droideka miniatures, or simply mark the unit with a Wheel Mode token until the end of the Round.

Players should use the ball-form Droideka miniatures only when the unit uses the Wheel Mode keyword and only for the duration of that Round. At the end of the Round, any ballform Droideka miniatures should be replaced with standing Droideka miniatures.

WOUND X

The first time a unit with the Wound X keyword enters play, that unit suffers X Wounds.

ANTI-PERSONNEL X

CUMBE RSOME

When a unit makes an attack that has the Anti-Personnel X keyword in the Attack Pool, if the defending unit is a Trooper unit, upgrade X of that weapon's attack dice.

AREA WEAPON

D ETONATE X: (CHARGE T YPE)

A weapon with a yellow Range icon is an area weapon. When using an area weapon, make a separate attack against each unit, allied and enemy, that is in LOS and within the Range indicated by the number on the Range icon, even if that unit is Engaged. Attacks made by area weapons are always Ranged attacks.

Area weapons can never be in an Attack Pool made by a unit and must always be the only weapon in an Attack Pool.

ARM X: CHARGE TOKEN TYPE

A unit that is equipped with a card that has the Arm X: Charge Token Type keyword can make the Arm X action. When a unit makes the Arm X action, the unit places X Charge TOKENS of the specified type and matching its controlling player's color completely within 1 and LOS of its unit leader.

Charge TOKENS cannot overlap any Objective, Advantage, or other Charge TOKENS and must be placed on a flat surface completely flush with that surface.

BEAM X

If a weapon with the Beam X keyword is in a unit's Attack Pool during the Declare Additional Defender step, that unit may declare up to X additional attacks, forming Attack Pools using only the weapon with the Beam X keyword, even though the weapon has already been added to an Attack Pool. These additional attacks do not generate further attacks.

Each additional attack must be against a different defending unit that is within 1 of the last defending unit declared. These additional attacks must be in LOS of the attacking unit but do not have to be within the maximum Range of the weapon with the Beam X keyword.

After a unit attacks, Moves, or makes an action, each unit that has a weapon with the Detonate X keyword may Detonate up to X allied Charge TOKENS of the specified type. If a token would detonate, that token detonates before any other abilities or effects that occur after a unit Moves or makes an action, with the exception of spending a Standby token which can be spent by a unit before the token detonates. If both players have units that could detonate Charge TOKENS, the player that does not control the unit that just made the attack, Move, or action may use their unit's Detonate X keyword first.

When a token detonates, make a separate attack against each unit, allied and enemy, that has LOS to the token and is in Range of the area weapon, using the surge conversion chart and weapon keywords on the card for the token being detonated. The detonating token is considered the attacking unit when making attacks, meaning that it cannot spend Aim TOKENS or modify attack dice, regardless of any abilities on the unit that placed the token. After a token detonates, remove it from the battlefield.

bases overlapped an enemy miniature's base. After the Move is resolved, the unit with the Overrun weapon makes an attack against the unit it moved through, and ignores Range when making this attack. A unit can only form 1 Attack Pool when making an Overrun attack, and only weapons with the Overrun X keyword can be added to the Attack Pool. The Overrun weapon is only added to the Attack Pool once, even if there are multiple miniatures in the unit.

If a unit can make multiple Overrun attacks during its Activation, it must make a separate Move through an enemy unit for each Overrun attack.

IONX

PIERCE X

When a Vehicle or Droid Trooper unit suffers 1 or more Wounds from an attack that has the Ion X keyword in the Attack Pool, after the attack is resolved, it gains X Ion TOKENS.

When a unit starts its Activation with 1 or more Ion TOKENS, roll 1 white defense die for each Ion token it has. If any Blank results are rolled, that unit makes 1 fewer action during that Activation. At the end of a unit's Activation, it removes any Ion TOKENS that it has.

If an Attack Pool includes the Ion X keyword, at the start of the Modify Attack Dice step, before RESOLVING other effects the defending unit must flip 1 active Shield token, if able, for each a or b result in the attack roll, to a maximum of X TOKENS flipped.

LETHAL X

When a unit makes an attack with an Attack Pool that has Lethal X, it can spend up to X Aim TOKENS during the Modify Attack Dice step. If it does, the Attack Pool gains Pierce 1 for each Aim token spent. The attacking unit may not reroll dice with any Aim TOKENS spent in this way.

LONGSHOT

When a unit with a weapon that has the Long Shot keyword makes an attack, before choosing an enemy unit to attack during the Declare Defender step, it may spend 1 Aim token to increase the maximum Range of that weapon by 1 until the end of that attack sequence. The attacking unit may not reroll dice with any Aim TOKENS spent in this way. Only 1 Aim token may be spent in this way per attack sequence.

OVERRUN X
A weapon with a red overrun Range icon (8) is an Overrun weapon and can only be used during Overrun attacks. Overrun attacks are not Ranged or Melee attacks. A unit may make X Overrun attacks during its activation. A unit with an Overrun weapon can make an Overrun attack after it makes a Standard Move in which the Movement Tool or one of its miniatures'

When a unit attacks with an Attack Pool that has Pierce X keyword it may cancel up to X d results during the Modify Defense Dice step. The Pierce X keyword can be used to cancel d results on defense dice rolled by a unit using the Guardian X keyword. When doing so, treat canceled d results as Blank results. After using the Pierce X keyword in this way, any unused Pierce X value can still be used to cancel d results rolled by the defending unit.

For EXAMPLE, a unit with Pierce 3 attacks an enemy unit, and another enemy unit uses Guardian 2 to cancel 2 a results. After converting defense e results, the unit using Guardian has rolled 2 d results. The attacking unit uses Pierce to cancel the 2 d results and the unit using Guardian suffers 2 Wounds.

Now the defending unit rolls defense dice and the attacking unit may cancel 1 more d result rolled by the defending unit since only 2 of its original Pierce 3 have been used so far.

POISO NX

A non-Droid Trooper Trooper unit that suffers 1 or more Wounds caused by an Attack Pool that has the Poison X keyword gains X Poison TOKENS.

When a unit with 1 or more Poison TOKENS ends its Activation, it suffers 1 Wound for each Poison token it has, then removes all of its Poison TOKENS.

RAMX

While a unit makes an attack with an Attack Pool that has the Ram X keyword, during the Modify Attack Dice step, it may change X results to b results if it meets either of the
following conditions:

- The unit leader has a notched base and the unit made at least 1 full Standard Move at its Speed during the same Activation as an attack using Ram X.

- The unit leader has an unnotched base and the unit made at least 1 Move during the same Activation as an attack using Ram X.

SPRA Y

When a miniature adds a weapon that has the Spray keyword to an Attack Pool, that weapon adds its dice a number of times equal to the number of miniatures in the defending unit that are in LOS of the miniature using that weapon.

For EXAMPLE, if an AT-RT with a flamethrower attacks a unit of 3 Death Troopers, since the flamethrower has the Spray keyword and an attack value of 2 black die, the flamethrower contributes 6 black attack dice to the Attack Pool.

S UPPRESSIVE

When a unit defends against an Attack Pool that has Suppressive, it gains 1 additional Suppression token during the Assign Suppression Token to Defender step.

TOWCABLE

After a Vehicle suffers 1 or more Wounds from an attack that has Tow Cable in the Attack Pool, the attacking player makes a Pivot with that Vehicle, then it gains 1 Immobilize token.

UPGRADE AND
COMMAND CARD
KEY WORDS

BANE TOKENS

Cad Bane has a set of 3 unique Bane TOKENS that he can place on the battlefield. Bane TOKENS are double-sided, with a uniform back and 3 different images on the front, each linked to a unique effect.

Bane TOKENS must be placed facedown on the battlefield and cannot overlap Objective or Advantage TOKENS. Bane TOKENS are enemy effects. Each player may only have 1 copy of each different Bane token on the battlefield at the same time.

When an enemy miniature Moves, Deploys, or is placed within 1 of an enemy Bane token, if that miniature has LOS to the token, that Bane token is revealed. Miniatures can Move through but not overlap Bane TOKENS. When a Bane token is
revealed, it has 1 of the following effects:

Here I Am: If Cad Bane is not on the battlefield and is not defeated, his Here I Am token is replaced by his miniature. Then, Cad Bane issues himself an Order. -

If Cad Bane is on the battlefield, his Here I Am token is replaced by his miniature. Any TOKENS assigned to Cad Bane remain assigned to him. -

If Cad Bane is defeated, the token is removed.

- At the start of each Round, starting with the blue player, a player may reveal an allied Here I Am token and resolve it.

Smoke and Mirrors: The token is removed.

DIVU LGE

Some COMMAND Cards have the Divulge keyword. COMMAND Cards that contain the Divulge keyword are divided by a horizontal line, which serves to visually separate the Divulge keyword effect from the normal COMMAND Card effect. Some Divulge cards have multiple options, in this case the player must pick 1. These cards can be revealed at the start of the phase or step indicated by the Divulge keyword. If a card is revealed in this manner, resolve the text that follows the Divulge keyword.

A card that is revealed in this way is not played and is returned to that player's COMMAND Hand at the end of the step in which it was Divulged. Players can Divulge as many COMMAND Cards as they wish. If both players have COMMAND Cards that are Divulged at the same time, the blue player can reveal their COMMAND Card first. If this opportunity is declined, that card can no longer be Divulged.

GRAFFITI TOKEN S

A Graffiti token represents a striking image or symbol painted onto the terrain of the battlefield. Graffiti TOKENS affect a unit's morale. Graffiti TOKENS have 2 sides. Players should place the Graffiti token flat on a surface so that the side that corresponds to their player color is faceup.

During a unit's Rally step, it may roll 1 additional die if it has LOS to and is within 2 of an allied Graffiti token. If it has LOS and is within 2 of an enemy Graffiti token, it must roll 1 fewer die, to a minumum of 1.

Graffiti TOKENS remain in play until the end of the game. Units may Move through and end a movement overlapping Graffiti TOKENS.

LEADER

A miniature with the Leader keyword is treated as a unit's unit leader for all rules purposes.

If a miniature with the Leader keyword and a Wound threshold of 2 or more is defeated while in a unit with a Wound threshold of 1, replace 1 of the remaining miniatures in that unit as normal, then assign the miniature with the Leader keyword 1 Wound token.

Kablamo!: The token detonates using the weapon profile on Cad Bane's I Make the Rules Now COMMAND Card, then the token is removed.

Each unit may only equip 1 upgrade card with the Leader keyword.

NONCOMBA TANT

CYCLE

At the end of a unit's Activation, ready each of its exhausted Upgrade Cards with the Cycle keyword that was not used during that Activation. Only using the weapon, keywords, or other card text on the card counts as using that Upgrade Card.

A miniature with the Noncombatant keyword cannot add any weapons to Attack Pools, and any Wounds suffered must be assigned to non-unit leader miniatures without the Noncombatant keyword, if able. If a miniature with the Noncombatant keyword already has 1 or more Wound TOKENS, it must be assigned Wounds before miniatures that do not have Wound TOKENS. If the unit leader miniature in a unit with the Noncombatant keyword is defeated, a Noncombatant miniature cannot be replaced by a new unit leader miniature unless there are no other miniatures without the Noncombatant keyword. 60

For EXAMPLE, the T-series Tactical Droid Upgrade Card provides a Ranged weapon and has the Sidearm: Ranged keyword. The miniature added by that upgrade can only use the weapon on the T-series Tactical Droid upgrade during a Ranged attack. That miniature may still use any available Melee weapon, such as the Melee weapon on the B1-Battle Droids Unit Card, during a Melee attack.

SMAL L

A unit that has 1 or more Counterpart miniatures with the Small keyword cannot be targeted with attacks if the attacking unit leader only has LOS to the Counterpart miniature with the Small keyword

TREAT X: CAPACIT YY

When a unit uses the Treat X: Capacity Y Card or Free Card action, choose an allied non-Droid Trooper Trooper unit within 1 and LOS and place 1 Wound token on the card that has the Treat X: Capacity Y keyword. Remove a total of up to X Wound and/or Poison TOKENS from the chosen unit or Restore up to X miniatures to that unit. This ability cannot be used if the card that has the Treat X: Capacity Y keyword has a number of Wound TOKENS on it equal to or exceeding Y.

Wound TOKENS on cards are not considered to be on units and do not count toward a unit's Wound threshold, nor can they be removed by abilities that remove Wound TOKENS from units.

A unit that has multiple Treat X: Capacity Y actions treats each keyword as a separate action, and can use each action once during its Activation, even if the unit has access to mutiple identical actions from different sources.

P ERMANENT

Some COMMAND Cards have the Permanent keyword. Unlike ordinary COMMAND Cards, these cards are not discarded from play during the End Phase and their effects persist as long as they are in play.

RECONFIGURE

When a unit equipped with an Upgrade Card that has the Reconfigure keyword makes a Recover action, that unit's controlling player may flip that Upgrade Card to a different side in addition to any other effects of that Recover action.

If an Upgrade Card has the exhaust icon, using the Reconfigure ability does not cause that Upgrade Card to be exhausted.

REPAIR X: CAPACITY Y

When a unit uses the Repair X: Capacity Y Card or Free Card action, choose an allied Droid Trooper or Vehicle unit within 1 and LOS and place 1 Wound token on the card that has the Repair X: Capacity Y keyword. Remove a total of up to 1 Wound, Ion, and/or Vehicle Damage TOKENS from the chosen unit or Restore up to X miniatures to that unit. This ability cannot be used if the card that has the Repair X: Capacity Y keyword has a number of Wound TOKENS on it equal to or exceeding Y.

Wound TOKENS on cards are not considered to be on units and do not count toward a unit's Wound Threshold, nor can they be removed by abilities that remove Wound TOKENS from units.

A unit that has multiple Repair X: Capacity Y actions treats each keyword as a separate action, and can use each action once during its Activation, even if the unit has access to mutiple identical actions from different sources.

RESTORE

Some abilities, such as the Treat and Repair keywords or certain CARD EFFECTS, allow a player to Restore miniatures to allied units. To Restore a miniature to a unit, that unit must have had 1 or more miniatures defeated that Round. Choose a miniature that was defeated during the current Round and place that miniature on the battlefield in Cohesion with its unit leader. Then, give that miniature a number of Wound TOKENS equal to 1 less than the Wound threshold indicated on its Upgrade Card or Unit Card.

S IDEARM: MELEE/RANGED

If an upgrade has the Sidearm: Melee keyword, the miniature added by that upgrade or that has that upgrade equipped cannot add any Melee weapons to Attack Pools other than any Melee weapons on the Upgrade Card with the Sidearm: Melee keyword.

If an upgrade has the Sidearm: Ranged keyword, the miniature added by that upgrade or that has that upgrade equipped cannot add any Ranged weapons to Attack Pools other than
any Ranged weapons on the Upgrade Card with the Sidearm:
Ranged keyword. 61
